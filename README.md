Maximum Power Point Tracking for solar panels using Ant Colony Optimization

Output power of solar panel varies with respect to irradiance and temperature through out the day. Therefore, it is very important that maximum power should be extracted from solar panels by varying the duty cycle of DC/DC coverters. This technique is known as Maximum Power Point Tracking. As irradiance changes continuously during the day, many algorithms fail to give maximum power as they get stuck at local maximum. In order to overcome this problem, we propose Ant Colony Optimization which obtains global maximum and improves the efficiency of solar panels.

The repo contains MATLAB simulation model set-up with PV panel, Ant Colony optimization algorithm to find out the required duty cycle, and a buck-boost converter.

Configuration and algorithms can be easily modified according to the user requirements.
